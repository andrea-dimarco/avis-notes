Useful scripts for the course.
The course project's repository is [here](https://github.com/andrea-dimarco/high-dimensional-space-anomaly-detection).

- [Linear Difference Solver](linear_difference_solver.m): MATLAB script that returns the solution for the models as linear difference equations, if the solution are complex an additional alpha and phi parameters will be returned to put in the classic formula.

- [Stationary Time-Series Plot](stationary-time-series-plot.py): Python script that given the parameters of a (mean and variance) stationary model, returns the plots for the time-series, the ACF and PACF.
